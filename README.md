Operating systems evolved from simple mainframe setups in the 1950s to today's complex, user-friendly platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux. Key milestones include the advent of Unix in the 1970s, Windows dominance in the PC market in the 1990s, and the rise of mobile operating systems like Android and iOS in the 2000s.

## Week 7
### What is Shell ?
Shell is a ```command-line interface (CLI)``` that allows users to interact with the computer system by entering commands. Shell is gateway to the operating system's services and functions. in Unix-based operating systems like Linux, MacOS and ... there are several popular shells :
* [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) - Linux, MacOS
* [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) - Linux, MacOS
* [Power Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) - Windows

### What is Bash ?
Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a popular ```command-line interpreter``` or shell for Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It's the ```default``` shell for most Linux distributions and macOS.

### What is Terminal ?
Terminal is a software interface that allows users to interact with a computer system using text-based commands ```(I/O)```. It provides a way to enter shell commands to the operating system and receive textual output.

### What is Shell Script
Shell Script is a ```script or program``` written in a scripting language that is interpreted by a shell, such as ```Bash``` in Unix-like operating systems. Shell scripts are used to ```automate tasks```, ```execute commands```, and perform ```system administration tasks```.

### Why ```Everything in Linux is File``` ?
The principle that "everything is a file" is a fundamental concept in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It embodies the idea that in the Unix/Linux environment, various system resources are represented as files or file-like objects. This simplifies the design and usage of the operating system, as it allows uniform access and manipulation of different resources through a common interface.
for example :
* Your computer's webcam is a file (located at ```/dev/video0```)
* Your mouse and keyboard (located at ```/dev/input/by-id/```)
* Your ls command (located at ```/usr/bin/ls```)
* Your SSD (located at ```/dev/disk/by-id```)

### How to Write Shell Script ?
1. Open your terminal and create a new file like ```touch my_script.sh```. You can name it whatever you like, but make sure it has a ```.sh``` extension to indicate it's a ```shell script```.
2. Use any text editor you are comfortable with, for example use nano
3. The ```first line``` of your script should be the ```shebang line```. This tells the system which ```interpreter``` to use to run the script. For a ```Bash``` shell script, use :
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
4. Add the commands you want to execute. Hereâ€™s an example script that create new file named file.txt and directory named copy_here and then copy file.txt to copy_here directory :
```bash
#!/bin/bash

touch file.txt
mkdir copy_here
cp file.txt copy_here
```
5. save your file
Now you have created a shell script.


### How to Run (Execute) Shell Script ?
Before you can run the script, you need to make it executable. Use the chmod command to do this :
```sh
chmod +x my_script.sh
```
but what is ```chmod``` and ```+x``` ?  
In Unix-like operating systems (like Linux), every file and directory has a set of permissions that determine who can read, write, or execute the file  
There are three types of permissions:
* Read (r): Permission to read the file.
* Write (w): Permission to modify the file.
* Execute (x): Permission to run the file as a program.
for example if you do command ```ls -l``` that shows lsit of file as detailed list, you see this line for ```my_script.sh``` :
```sh
ls -l

-rw-rw-r-- 1 qb qb 0 May 14 08:30 my_script.sh
```
First part ```-rw-rw-r--```'s 3-charactered section ```rw-``` only has ```r``` and ```w```, it means my_script.sh can be writen or read but not execute because execute part is ```-```. to add execute permission you must do that ```chmod +x my_script.sh``` command, if you that you will see this instead :
```sh
ls -l

-rwxrwxr-x 1 qb qb 0 May 14 08:30 my_script.sh
```
Now you can see execute permission ```x``` has been added to file and it can be seen like ```rwx``` instead ```rw-```, that means my_script.sh can be run in terminal like this :
```sh
./my_script.sh
```
that ```./``` at first shows current directory ```.``` explained in [this part](#3-linux-path-addres-symbols). It can be other path if you are not inside my_script.sh's directory like :
```bash
# home path
~/Desktop/my_script.sh
# or full path (needed in systemd services projects)
/home/qb/Desktop/my_script.sh
```

### Why i can not use ```my_script.sh``` to run my script instead of ```./my_script.sh```
When you try to run a script using my_script.sh instead of ./my_script.sh, your shell looks for the script in the directories listed in your ```PATH environment variable```. If the ```current directory (.)``` is not in your PATH, the shell ```won't find the script```.

### Linux Commands
*[echo](#19-echo)
* [grep](#20-grep)

### 19. [echo](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/echo-command-in-linux-with-examples/)
The echo command is a basic command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that prints the specified arguments to the standard output. It is commonly used to display text or variables in shell scripts or interactively in a terminal session :
```bash
echo "Hello, world!"
```

### 20. [grep](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)
The grep command is a powerful tool used in Linux and Unix-like operating systems for searching ```text patterns``` within files or ```streams of input```.  
Examples :
1. Search text or pattern (here hello) in file
```bash
grep "hello world" file.txt
```
Common Options :
* -i: Ignore case distinctions.
```bash
grep -i "hELlO WOrlD" file.txt
```
* -r, -R: Recursively search subdirectories listed.
```bash
grep -r "hello world" directory/
```
* -n: Display line numbers along with matched lines.
```bash
grep -n "hello world" file.txt
```
* -v: Invert the match, i.e., display non-matching lines.
```bash
grep -v "bye world" file.txt
```
* -c: Only count the number of matching lines. (Here shows amount of your cpu cores)
```bash
grep -c "processor" /proc/cpuinfo
```
* -E: Interpret the pattern as an extended regular expression (ERE). (Here will shows lines that are mails and their extention is @gmail.com)
```bash
grep -E '\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@gmail\.com\b' emails.txt

# \b: Matches a word boundary, ensuring that the pattern matches complete email addresses and not partial ones.
# [A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+: Matches one or more characters that can appear in the local part of an email address. This includes letters (upper and lower case), digits, and special characters commonly allowed in email addresses.
# @gmail\.com: Matches the domain part of a Gmail address.
# \b: Matches another word boundary, ensuring that the pattern matches complete email addresses and not partial ones.
```
